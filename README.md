# how to delete a commit from github

## git reset --soft HEAD~1
## git push origin --force

Now with gut origin --force
the commit gets deleted from github too. 

due to the soft flag, I still have it in my local showing in green which means it is still in the staging area. 


## I write these things on github in read.md file and then i want to get those changes locally.
